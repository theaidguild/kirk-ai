          # publish_branch: gh-pages

# Note: if your organization or repository settings restrict the GITHUB_TOKEN's write permissions, the action may still fail with "Write access to repository not granted." In that case either:
# - Adjust repository or organization Actions permissions to allow write access for workflows, or
# - Create a personal access token with repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite and add it as a secret (e.g. GH_PAGES_PAT) and pass it as `personal_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_PAT }}` to the peaceiris action.
